                    <center><p>Education helps you develop critical skills like decision-making, mental agility, problem-solving, and logical thinking. People face problems in their professional as well as personal lives. In such situations, their ability to make rational and informed decisions comes from how educated and self-aware they are</p></center>
                   <h4> Why is it necessary to get educated?</h4>
                       <p>Even though education has different definitions, there is one thing terrestrially acknowledged upon; its importance! There are infinite reasons why education is crucial. It has unlimited connotations and implications. Here is why. 
                        Helps to think clearly: Education acquaints youngsters with the atmosphere around them. It encourages them to be more mindful of their strengths and flaws and teaches them to drive their focus in the right direction.<br><br>
                        Fills courage to face any situation: Education teaches children that failure is not an end; they should try until they succeed and never give up. It fuels their determination to live in the world autonomously and encounter any circumstances bravely.
                        Teaches values and delivers equality- Frederic Douglass said, “It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.” It is necessary to educate and infuse moral values and frame character right from childhood. Childhood education will help children develop honesty, kindness, generosity, courage, freedom, equality, and respect. <br><br>It frames better behavior and adds discipline. These values will standardize dignity and equality in the world by warding off the gaps between social classes. And will generate equal opportunities in every field worldwide.
                        Ensures a secure and better future for children: Benjamin Franklin accurately stated that an investment in education returns the best interest. Education is a fruit-bearing tree which once grown fully, will bear fruits and serve you throughout life. It is a necessary trail to get financially sound in the future. Parents, for the same reason, insist children on studying well and pursuing higher education.<br><br>
                        Makes the world a better place to live: Children today are the ones who will shape the world tomorrow. Educating children not only secures their personal life but collectively contributes to the development of a more reliable nation and the world. It can yield a better surrounding in which people can differentiate between right and wrong, know the importance of voting, adhere to laws, and reduce crimes.</p> 
                    <h4>DONATE NOW TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</h4>
                        <img src="https://wildlifesos.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/feature-image-education-support-900x600.jpg" style="width:1520px">
                        <h4>YOUR DONATIONS HAVE CHANGED LIVES.</h4>
                        <p id="dono">Education donations can help address the global education crisis. While progress has been made in improving access to education over the years, there is still a long way to go. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the education crisis, with school closures and disruptions affecting over 1.38 billion children worldwide. Education donations can help support education systems, teachers, and students during these challenging times. For example, donations for schools can be used to provide technology and internet access to children who are learning remotely or to support teachers with training and resources to deliver quality education online

                            There are many ways to donate to education programs and schools.<br><br> Here are some examples:
                            
                            Donate to schools or programs in your community so that more and more children can avail the benefits of education.
                            
                            Support a non-profit organization that focuses on providing mid-day meals for school-going children so that more and more children get their education such as Annamrita Foundation
                            
                            Participate in fundraising events that support education, such as charity runs or auctions.
                            
                            Volunteer your time to support education programs, such as tutoring or mentoring.<br><br>
                            
                            When donating to education programs, it is important to do your research to ensure that your donation will have a meaningful impact. Look for organizations that are transparent about their finances and have a proven track record of success. Consider donating to organizations that focus on education in specific regions or on particular issues, such as girls’ education or early childhood education.<br><br>
                            
                            On a final note access to education empowers individuals to break the cycle of poverty, leading to better health outcomes, higher earning potential, and increased social mobility. Supporting education also has a ripple effect on communities and economies, as educated individuals are better equipped to contribute positively to society. Your donation can make a real and lasting difference in the lives of those who need it most.</p>
